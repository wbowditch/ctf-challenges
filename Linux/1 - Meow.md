# Welcome to the wonderful world of Linux 

These challenges will start off simple, teaching the basics of the Linux Command Line Interface(CLI) and some of the commonly used commands, and as you work through will get increasingly more difficult 

To access the challenges you will need a terminal emulator program such as PuTTY which can be downloaded from here: https://www.putty.org/ or if you are using one of our local machines in C27 it should already be installed 

At the beginning of each challenge, you will be given a host IP & port number. Using PuTTY, you will need to connect to the server using the given credentials. After connecting, you will need to provide a username and password. Each challenge will have a differnt username and the password. We will provide you with the username for each challenge, but the password will be the flag from the previous challenge
