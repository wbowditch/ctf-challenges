we think a hacker has been steganographically encoding secret messages into images to start a political uprising!
We were able to intercept one of these images however have not been able to decode the message but
After raiding his home and seizing his computer we were able to find what we think is the original image that has not been encoded yet
can you find out what this hacker has been sending?
